# MindBodyHealth

MindBodyHealth is a django-based blog site which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. It seeks to help people learn to thrive in this fast-paced and highly-demanding world by collecting testimonies of people who overcame chronic stress, burnout and mental health challenges by applying scientifically proven simple techniques proferred to them by their counsellors that rewired their brains and restored and retained their mind and body health. The site will be targeted towards all kinds of people, but especially towards students, workers and parents on whom the demands of society keep increasing on every side. The stories in this blog site are real and have been recorded by book authors, some of which were their counsellors and others are the authors' own experiences.
